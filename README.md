A level NEA - 3d rendering - can interpret OBJ primitively - can rotate the objects in 3d space and can use coloured faces - also has a command line
Run the project with the testtkinter.py file, go to the instruction_set dictionary for the codes accepted by the command line and go to the functions corresponding to their variable names for how they work.
